            <p>Pesticide runoff pollutes water systems and harms the wildlife and communities that rely on them. Here are the facts:
                <ul>
                    <li>Some pesticides can remain in soil and water for years. Many of these pesticides have been banned in developed countries, but are still used in the developing world.</li>
                    <li>"Cleanup of groundwater contaminated by pesticides is usually impossible." - Cornell Uninversity Cooperative Extension</li>
                    <li>Approximately 10% of the U.S.'s population relies on water provided by private wells, which are not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act.</li>
                </ul>
                To see the harm of pesticide runoff in action, watch:

                </p>
            </p>

           
            <p>To those who live don't rely on private wells, remember that pesticide residue may still be present in your food! Do you know what percent of apples tested by the EWG contained pesticide residue? Over 90%, or way too much &#128561;! Here are the facts: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Over 5 million cases of pesticide poisoning and related death are reported each year.</li>
                    <li>Poisoning can occur after even brief exposure through the skin, eyes, mouth, or longs.</li>
                    <li>Short term effects include vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and even seizures.</li>
                    <li>Long term exposure has been linked to cancer, sterility, Alzheimers, and neurological damage.</li>
                    <li>One study found that pregnant women with high pesticide residue exposure are 26% less likely to have a live birth than women with low pesticide residue exposure.</li>
                </ul></p>
