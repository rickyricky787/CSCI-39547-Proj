            <h1>Pesticides: Why should you care?</h1>
            <p>Pesticide runoff pollutes water systems and harms the wildlife and communities that rely on them. Even if you're selfish, you still have something to gain from keeping them away from your food. Pesticide residue may still be present in your food!!!</p>
            
            <h2 style= "color:red">What are we going to do about it?</h2>
        <p>We only use organic farming practicesto grow your food. As a community owned garden, we answer to those that are directly affected by our production practices.</p>

        <p>A whole lot &#128561;!!!!!</p>
