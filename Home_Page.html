            <p>
                Join our Urban Youth Program! A 3-month internship where volunters receive an in-depth and hands-on experience in environmental science, agriculture, and green technology. Those who are interested will be allowed to work on our own personal acre farm and greenhouse from which any fruit/vegetable produced will be supplied to the applicant's own farm stand! We will be hosting weekly workshops related to a variety of topics ranging from the environmental effects of pesticide-use to industrial farming and deforestation.
