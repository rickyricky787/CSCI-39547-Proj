                    Problems with Desertification
                </h1>

            <p>
                The United Nations defines desertification as "land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and human activities". Degradation can happen anywhere in the world, except in Antarctica. Some of the causes of desertification include <b>overgrazing</b> and <b>unsustainable agriculture techniques</b>. Our community garden will aim to stop degradation in our community little by little by following several practices.            </p>
            <h2>
                Overgrazing
            </h2>
            <p>
                Having too many herbivore and omnivore animals in an area can reduce the amount of grass being reproduced. These animals could eat all of the grass available, or they can stomp on them repeatedly, negatively affecting the growth of the grass. Our community garden aims to have a limited number of animals and insects to prevent overgrazing. They will be fed with a reasonable amount of crops from a special section in our garden that is only reserved for animal food. In the case of having some sort of shortage due to an unprecedented event, we have partnered with our local farms to donate vegetables for animals and insects in our care.            </p>
            <h2>
                Poor Agriculture
            </h2>
            <p>
                Many community gardens fail to provide the necessary tilling for a sustainable garden. Others even leave the soil exposed, which can lead to wind and rain erosion. This heavy contribution contributes to poor quality crops. Our garden has a <b>“no-tilt”</b> policy, which reduces the amount of soil erosion caused by tilting and permits nutrient recycling. Also,<b> 80%</b> of our plants are inside high tunnels, which protects crops and plants from the weather and keeps them cultivated during off-season periods.            </p>
